- ResNet18
- ResNet is an artificial neural network architecture primarily designed for addressing computer vision149
problems. It incorporates residual blocks to enable the bypassing of layers, deliberately reducing150
information loss by fusing the output from the previous layer with the current layer. The naming151
convention of the model depends on the depth of the layer
