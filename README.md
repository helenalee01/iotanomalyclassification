1) MFCC feature extraction is performed followed by PCA application
2) ResNet18
- ResNet is an artificial neural network architecture primarily designed for addressing computer vision problems. It incorporates residual blocks to enable the bypassing of layers, deliberately reducing150
information loss by fusing the output from the previous layer with the current layer. The naming convention of the model depends on the depth of the layer.

3) MFCC-based ResNet18 Model applied

* Approach can be applied to the IoT network dataset as well as other time series datasets, where the data is transmitted through visible or invisible mediums serving as pipelines, to enhance classification125
accuracy. Moreover, the time series data should have the features of Trends, Seasonality, Residuals for better performance.
